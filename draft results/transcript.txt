what summarizes to Miracle from Sharky's how spontaneous that people aren't  I asked myself became a little bit like that so I'm also very direct but I know in Poland for example people especially towards people who you do not know you shouldn't sometimes say thanks in the Netherlands there's no limitation for me it was like coming home like when I got to this country and I found out how to write people where I was like about these are my people they tell you what they think English of notorious for not saying what they mean I love that kind of person who can catch what the meaning of the word so it's really good for me personality when talking to my parents over the phone sometimes I I explain things like in a very direct and short way most efficiently post as possible and they asked me back are you mad or something or you tired because it's just not normal for them and I I understand that I noticed an ad at a train stop for clothes  slogan was a fitting to stand out and that just caught me of something that I would never see in the US that would just never happen the US has so much more of a focus on you doing everything yourself then the Dutch culture it seems like they feel more responsible as members of society in here people are just you know more easy-going anyway it's just easier to approach did you experience coffee shop when you came here I don't think people experience that. Horse cultures shots to share a lot  no it's 1:00 bitterballen one glass of juice and then sing Andrea has a song at 4 in the morning also like we don't have time to finish so don't plan anything after because you not going to say that's okay and they are very well organized they put everything on their agendas so even okay let's go out for a drink to get the agenda and the city okay Joe's on boils down to the level of respect that people have to each other's time you need to be very observant and not expect to just push your values on them you know and if you're if you listen and you observing you watch you will be able to enter  waiting to be able to work that much quicker with Dutch people I think but that go that's any I think that's any society if you don't learn the language you miss out on so much and you never really are going to fully understand the people that are living next to you so they are like he's trying to speak English minutes later they speak in the chicken when there are those like rare occasions where it's just Dutch that people are speaking then it can be quite awkward and it reminds me that I'm not really well-integrated and that I would like to be more integrated
